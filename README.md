# Izik – Personal Portfolio

A modern, fast, and minimal portfolio built with **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS**, designed to showcase my work as a Web Developer and Architectural Designer — blending logic with spatial creativity.

> “Code is more than logic — it’s architecture, poetry, and responsibility.”

## 🎯 Vision

I design at the intersection of architecture and technology — crafting digital platforms with the same intentionality as physical spaces. Every interface is treated like a structure: functional, human‑centered, and built to endure.
